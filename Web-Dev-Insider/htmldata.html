    <h1>HTML [Hyper Text Markup Language]</h1>
    <center><img src="./IMAGE/html.png" height="350px" width="500px"></center>
    <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
        
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as  directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as  surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the  element, together with JavaScript.</p>
        <h2>What is HTML ?</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language<br>
            HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages<br>
            HTML describes the structure of a Web page<br>
            HTML consists of a series of elements<br>
            HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content<br>
            HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>
        <h2>A Simple HTML Document</h2>
        <img src="./IMAGE/html document.png" height="300" width="400px">
        <p>The DOCTYPE html declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document<br>
        The HTML element is the root element of an HTML page<br>
        The Head element contains meta information about the HTML page <br>
        The Title element specifies a title for the HTML page<br>
        The Body element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.<br>
        The H1 element defines a large heading<br>
        The P element defines a paragraph</p>
        <h2>What is an HTML Element</h2>
        <img src="./IMAGE/html element.png" height="300px" width="400px">
        <p>An HTML element is a type of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document component, one of several types of HTML nodes (there are also text nodes, comment nodes and others).[vague] The first used version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 and there have since been many versions of HTML. The current de facto standard is governed by the industry group WHATWG and is known as the HTML Living Standard.

            An HTML document is composed of a tree of simple HTML nodes, such as text nodes, and HTML elements, which add semantics and formatting to parts of document (e.g., make text bold, organize it into paragraphs, lists and tables, or embed hyperlinks and images). Each element can have HTML attributes specified. Elements can also have content, including other elements and text.</p>
        <h2>Web Browsers</h2>
        <img src="./IMAGE/Web Browsers.png" height="300px" width="500px">
        <p>A web browser is an application for accessing websites. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user's screen. Browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people have used a browser.[1] The most-used browser is Google Chrome, with a 64% global market share on all devices, followed by Safari with 19%.[2]

            A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused.[3][4] A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.[5] In some technical contexts, browsers are referred to as user agents.</p>
        <h2>HTML Page Structure</h2>
        <img src="./IMAGE/page stucture.png" height="300px" width="400px">
        <h2>HTML History</h2>
        <img src="./IMAGE/html history.png" height="300px" width="500px">
        <h2>HTML Document</h2>
        <p>All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: !DOCTYPE html.<br>
            The HTML document itself begins with html  and ends with /html.<br>
            The visible part of the HTML document is between body and /body</p>
            
        <h2>Uses of HTML in Real World</h2>
        <br>
            <b>1. Web Pages Development</b>
            <p>Different websites we see on the internet regularly are in some form written in HTML code. As mentioned earlier HTML is used to structure the web page in various ways. We could include different sections, insert tables, and split the web page. With the introduction of Semantic HTML elements in HTML5, HTML has made hassle free even for the developer to understand and modify his/her code better. 

                Apart from the elements, we can style different types of web pages like the landing page, parallax pages, grid orientation pages, etc. Styling and manipulation of HTML elements are comparatively easier and more effective with CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            <b>2. Navigating the Internet</b>
            <p>HTML is an essential element in navigating between web pages. Navigation is possible using the hypertext concept. The linking is also simpler. From the internet user’s point of view, they click on a text which takes them to the next page. HTML facilitates navigation by hyperlinking with the help of an anchor tag.
                Navigation can increase visitors to a website. It increases user activity on the website. It also helps the web user to look at the content structure and organization.</p>   
            <b>3. Responsive Designs</b>
            <p>The integral part of a web page is for it to be interactive and responsive to the user. HTML makes it possible. Unlike static pages, responsive ones also have a better reach. Automatically resizing, hiding, shrinking, or enlarging a website to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones) is what a responsive web design is made of where HTML and CSS aid the purpose. 

                meta tag is used on all pages to create a responsive website. In addition, images could be made responsive with the help of the width property in CSS. Texts can also be made responsive by setting it up with a “VW” unit, which means the “viewport width”.</p>
            <b>4. Storage Function in the Browser</b>
            <p>Storage of data in the browser was tedious in the past. For a user to save the data of the browser that persists between two sessions, the user’s cookies or infrastructure is to be built from the server end. This process has now been eased with HTML5. HTML5 has roped in new features. Such storage features are localStorage and IndexDB.  

                The web storage objects window.localStorage and window.sessionStorage store data with no expiration date and storage for one session respectively. The localStorage object will have the data saved even when the browser is closed. setItem and removeItem are the functions commonly used to store and remove data from the storage. Also, the most important part is that these features are supported by all browsers.<br>
                <ins>To Store</ins> – localStorage.setItem(“username”, “Nisha”);<br>
                <ins>To Retrieve</ins> – document.getElementById(“result”).innerHTML = localStorage.getItem(“username”);<br>
                <ins>To Remove</ins> – localStorage.removeItem(“username”);            </p>
             <b>5. Data Entry Support</b>
             <p>With many other features that we have been discussing, here’s another important one to be taken into account which is data entry. For so long we have stored data in dedicated files for this purpose. HTML5 paves way for data entry online, that is to obtain the data to store, from the user via forms. In this case, we have HTML tags like <form>. 

                Other elements include input which may be a drop-down box, list, text box, password box, etc. On the whole, HTML makes the process of data entry easy and effective which also includes validations with the help of Javascript.</p>
             <b>6. Creation of Web Documents</b>    
             <p>HTML is predominantly used in creating web documents on the internet. DOM (Document Object Model) is used in the creation of web documents. In addition, HTML tags are used in formatting the document. The HTML web document begins with the declaration of !DOCTYPE html. Further, it proceeds with the usual HTML opening and closing tags. The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of objects. 

                The root element is the html which is divided into head and body. The Head contains the title of the page or document. The body consists of the content which is built using various elements such as headings, paragraphs, line breaks, anchors, etc. Further down the tree is the attributes of the elements. For instance, anchor tag a has an attribute say, ‘href’.</p> 
            <b>7. Game Development</b> 
            <p>We see in recent days, from kids, and teens to adults all of them are drowned in online games. Let us get to know the role of HTML in the creation of such games. Earlier game developments were specific to platforms like Flash. However, HTML5 offers many options and features for game development. Beginners can start with HTML elements such as canvas which offers all the functionality needed for making games. Javascript could be used to draw, insert images, write, etc into the canvas. CSS3 is an advanced version of Cascading Style Sheet used in structuring, styling, and formatting. Various components, controllers, etc are added making the game lively.
                 Thus, it is no longer a big deal to develop games.</p>
            <b>8. Offline Web Applications</b>
            <p>We know, it is always necessary to have internet connectivity to view web pages. However, nowadays web applications could be accessed even when we are offline. The user will be able to access the data with the help of HTML. It uses a cache manifest file to determine which data to store while offline. 

                In case you are traveling outside your Interner Service Provider’s Coverage Area, your connection is likely no more available. In this case, the user provides a manifest that lists the files which are needed for a web application to work offline. This causes the user’s browser to have a copy of the files for offline use.</p>
            <b>9. Cutting Edge Feature</b>
            <p>Cutting-edge is often used to describe disruptive technologies as well as the latest technological advancements. As we have looked so far, HTML5 has brought in many changes and advancements in web development. Cutting-edge web design trends include animated HTML headers, embeddable infographics, designing around illustrations with CSS, scroll-triggered call-to-action, user badges, etc.  

                Google Chrome serves to be an excellent choice of browser for the use of HTML’s recent set of standards and APIs. It lets the libraries download the required packages dynamically whenever required.</p>
            <b>10. Enrich the Website</b>
            <p>HTML allows the use of Native APIs to enrich the website. With the many features that HTML5 has introduced, it has also introduced many tools and capabilities that were never expected before. APIs like visibility, full screen, and media capture could be used to improve the experience of applications. 

                The APIs effectively allows us to do the background work independently of other UI scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. The major role of these APIs is to create custom controls and functions.</p>
            <h2>Top Features of HTML5 in 2024</h2>
            <br>
            <b>1. Semantic Elements</b>
            <p>When constructing an HTML script, the term “semantic” refers to the meaning of the text. Semantics, to put it simply, is the use of HTML tags that accurately reflect the content they contain. For instance, using the <div> tag doesn’t suggest the content it will carry, however using the <p> tag suggests it can be used to hold paragraph information. 

                There are a lot of reasons why you should write Semantic tags instead of normal HTML tags, to leverage SEO, accessibility, and browser compatibility. </p>
            <b>2. Audio and Video Support</b>
            <p>One of the many HTML 5 features is the support for audio and video. It has reduced the hassle of relying upon third-party services such as Adobe Flash player. To embed Audio and Video into your HTML document, you may use the following two tags, audio and video tags. 

                These two tags are launched with the release of HTML 5 and support a numerous range of attributes such as height, width, and more that offers developers to leverage the customization of HTML documents. </p>
            <b>3. Canvas Elements</b>
            <p>Canvas Elements is a top-notch feature that has made the tedious task of handling graphics easier for developers. With the help of Canvas elements, you can easily draw graphics using JavaScript. It is optimum for creating simple animations and drawing photo compositions. 

                To initialize the Canvas element canvas tag is used with only two specific attributes, width and height. Once, the element is initialized, it is then taken care of with the help of JavaScript to draw shapes, lines, images, and more.</p>
            <b>4. Geolocation API</b>
            <p>The Geolocation API is an HTML feature that is used to access the geographical position of a user, however, it is not accessed unless the user approves of it. If you’re wondering where this feature is useful, these come in handy while creating apps like taxi apps, food order tracking apps, fitness tracking apps, and more. 

                The location is achieved in a way that a user sends their longitude and latitude and this data is sent to the backend server, after which we access that data to create all these fancy applications. </p>
            <b>5. Local Storage </b>
            <p>It is a modern feature of HTML and several browsers that typically store data in the user’s browsers and can access them with the help of JavaScript APIs. This feature is useful for creating offline applications where data is need to be stored locally. 

                Moreover, using this feature you can reduce the transactions between the application and the backend server, creating a fast application. However, there are some limitations, such as there is limited storage, and you can not access more storage than that. </p>
            <b>6. Responsive Images</b>
            <p>Earlier to create responsive images on the web, you have to rely upon several lines of CSS and sometimes JavaScript, however, HTML 5 makes the process handy by including srcset attribute to specify multiple versions of an image at different screen resolutions. </p>
            <b>7. Web Workers</b>
            <p>When you are performing several demanding tasks at once, the browser gets sluggish and responds slowly. Because of this, web workers were added to HTML 5 to allow scripts to operate in the background without interfering with the UI thread. 

                This may be used to execute demanding operations like multimedia processing in the background. To further demonstrate the usage of Web Workers, we shall create a simple counter app that starts the counter when you click ‘start’ and stop the counting when you click ‘stop’. 
                </p>
            <b>8. Drag and Drop API</b>
            <p>Drag and drop is among the most unique features of HTML5 that allow you to grab any element in the DOM and drop it to a different location. To create an element able to drag and drop, set the attribute “draggable” on the tag and put its value to true. </p>
            <b>9. Form enhancements</b>
            <p>HTML 5 introduces new features for your existing forms on HTML to create a more robust user experience. Some of the key enhancements in the new HTML 5 include new input times such as email, URL, and more, placeholder text, required fields feature, validation, and more. </p>
            <b>10. Web Sockets</b>
            <p>In the previous versions of HTML, when a client sends a request to the backend server, the server then responds afterward. However, in HTML 5 we can establish a bidirectional live communication between the server and the client (a web browser) to reduce the latency in the responses. 

                It has its usage in large-scale applications due to its capability of handling large amounts of connections simultaneously between the server and the client such as online gaming applications, live trading, and other live low-latency applications. </p>
            <b>11. Micro Data </b>
            <p>Micro Data in simpler words is a further deeper level to provide semantics to your webpage. This feature is used to structure data in HTML documents by embedding your own customized elements. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>itemref </li>
                 <li>itemmid </li>   
                  <li>itemscope </li>  
                 <li> itemprop</li>   
                 <li>itemtype</li>    
            </ol>
            <p>These attributes are used to give the HTML elements more context to define the role they play in the webpage. Microdata may be used to specify a variety of structured data, such as details about events, items, companies, and more. Here is an example of how microdata can be used in HTML.

            </p>
            <b>12. Cross Document Messaging</b>
            <p>In general, web browsers don’t let web pages from different domains influence each other, this is done for several security reasons, however, even if the web pages don’t intend to intrigue the privacy or harm the other web page. There are several scenarios, in which you want to access cross-document communication to make your web page more interactive with less effort. 

                Some of these scenarios are when you want to embed data from third-party sites such as maps, photos, videos, and more. This can be achieved in HTML 5 with the feature of cross-document messaging, to enable real-time communication between different parts of websites opened in different frames, windows, etc. </p>
            <h2>Advantages of HTML</h2>
            <ol>

               <li> HTML has many tag and attributes which can short your line of code.</li>    
            </ol>
            <h2>Disadvantages of HTML</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>It cannot produce dynamic output alone, since it’s a static language.</li>
              <li>Making the structure of HTML documents becomes tough to understand.</li>      
              <li> Errors can be costly.</li>     
              <li>It is the time consuming as the time it consume to maintain on the color scheme of a page and to make lists, tables and forms.</li>      
              <li>We need to write a lot of code for just creating a simple webpage.</li>      
              <li> We have to check up the deprecated tags and confirm not to use them to appear because another language that works with HTML has replaced the first work of the tag, and hence the opposite language needs to be understood and learned.</li>     
              <li> Security features offered by HTML are limited.</li>     
              <li> If we need to write down long code for creating a webpage then it produces some complexity.</li>     
              <li>  HTML can create only static and plain pages so if we’d like dynamic pages then HTML isn’t useful.</li>    
              <li>  Editing of web page need to be done separately , they are not centralized.</li>    
                
            </ol>
            <h2>Comment Tag</h2>
            <img src="./IMAGE/comment.png" height="250px" width="550px">
            <p>The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. Comments are not displayed in the browsers. You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date.</p>
            <h2>Meta Tag</h2>
            <img src="./IMAGE/meta.png" height="300px" width="500px">
            <p>The meta tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

                meta tags always go inside the head element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
                
                Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
                
                Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.
                
                There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the meta tag (See "Setting The Viewport" example below).<br>
            <ins>Define keywords for search engines</ins><br>
            <ins>Define the author of a page</ins><br>
            <ins>Refresh document every 30 seconds</ins><br>
            <ins>Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices</ins>
            </p>
            <b>Setting the Viewport</b>
            <p>The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

                You should include the following meta element in all your web pages:
                
                meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
                This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
                
                The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

            <img src="./IMAGE/table.png" height="250px" width="350px">
            <p>The table element in HTML is used to display data in a tabular format, consisting of rows and columns. It is commonly used to organize and present information like schedules, pricing charts, comparisons, or any structured data. A table is made up of several elements like tr (table row), td (table data cell), and th (table header cell) to structure the content properly.<br><br>
            <ins>Key Elements of a Table:</ins>
            <li><ins>table:</ins> Defines the overall table structure.</li>

            <h2>Alignment</h2>
            <p>In HTML, alignment refers to the positioning of text, images, or other elements relative to their container. Alignment can be applied to content horizontally (left, center, right) or vertically (top, middle, bottom). HTML and CSS offer various ways to control alignment for elements</p>
            <b>1. Text Alignment (Horizontal)</b>
            <p>You can align text content using the text-align CSS property.
            <li>Left: Aligns text to the left (default for most browsers).</li>
            <li>Center: Centers the text.</li>
            <li>Right: Aligns text to the right.</li>
            <li>Justify: Stretches the text so that it aligns with both the left and right edges.</li></p>
            <b>2. Image Alignment (Horizontal)</b>
            <p>For aligning images, you can use the float or text-align properties.
            <li>Float: The float property can align images to the left or right of the content</li></p>
            <b>3. Vertical Alignment</b>
            <p>Vertical alignment refers to aligning elements vertically within their container. The vertical-align property is often used for inline or table-cell elements.

            <h2>Borders in HTML</h2>
            <img src="./IMAGE/border.png" height="400px" width="350px">
            <p>In HTML, borders are used to outline or frame elements, enhancing the visual structure and design of a webpage. Borders are primarily controlled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which allows you to set border styles, widths, and colors for HTML elements.<br><br>
            <ins>Key Properties for Borders in CSS:</ins>
            <ol>
                <li>border: A shorthand property for setting the border width, style, and color in one line.</li>

            <h2>Forms in HTML</h2>
            <img src="./IMAGE/form.png" height="250px" width="400px">
            <p>Forms in HTML are used to collect user input, such as text, choices, or file uploads, and submit this data to a server for processing. Forms are fundamental for interactive elements on websites, like sign-up forms, search fields, and feedback forms.<br><br><ins>Key Elements of an HTML Form:</ins>
            <ol>
            <li>form: The container element for form elements. It wraps all form controls and specifies how and where the form data should be submitted.</li>
            <li>input: A versatile element used for various types of user input, such as text, password, checkbox, radio, and file uploads.</li>
            <li>label: Defines a label for an input element. It helps improve accessibility by associating text labels with form controls.</li>
            <li>textarea: Provides a multi-line text input field, useful for longer text entries like comments or messages.</li>
            <li>select: Creates a dropdown list of options for users to choose from.</li>
            <li>button: Defines a clickable button, which can be used to submit the form or trigger other actions.</li>
            <li>fieldset: Groups related elements within a form, typically used with legend to provide a caption for the grouped elements.</li>
            <li>legend: Provides a caption or title for a fieldset.</li>
            </ol>
        <ins>Key Attributes:</ins>
            <li>action: Specifies the URL where the form data will be sent when the form is submitted.</li>
            <li>method: Defines the HTTP method (usually GET or POST) for sending form data.</li>    
            <li>name: Names each form control so that the server can identify and process the data.</li>    
            <li>id: Uniquely identifies form elements, often used with label for accessibility.</li>   
            <li>required: Indicates that a form field must be filled out before submitting the form.</li>    
            <li>rows and cols: Define the size of a textarea.</li>
        <ins>Form Controls:</ins>
        <li>input type="text": For single-line text input.</li>

        <li>input type="file": For file uploads.</li>    
        <li>button: Can be used as a submit button or for other actions.</li></p>
        <b>Required</b>
        <p>In HTML forms, the required attribute is used to specify that a particular input field must be filled out before submitting the form. When the required attribute is added to an input element, the form will not be submitted until the user provides a value for that field.<br><br>
        <ins>How to Use the required Attribute:</ins>
        Add required to Input Elements: You simply include the required attribute in the form control elements where input is mandatory.<br><br>
        <ins>Key Points:</ins>
        <ol>
        <li>Validation: The required attribute triggers browser-based validation. If the field is left empty, the browser will prevent form submission and display an error message.</li>
        <li>Error Message: The default error message displayed by the browser varies by browser and locale, but it usually indicates that the field is required.</li>
        <li>Multiple Fields: You can apply the required attribute to multiple fields in a form to ensure that all necessary information is provided.</li>
        <li>Types of Inputs: The required attribute can be used with various types of input elements, including input, select, and textarea.</li>
        </ol></p>
        <b>Placeholder</b>
        <p>The placeholder attribute in HTML is used to provide a hint or example text inside an input field or textarea that disappears when the user starts typing. It helps users understand what type of information is expected in a field and provides a visual cue about the input format.<br><br>
        <ins>Key Points:</ins>
        <ol>
        <li>Usage: The placeholder attribute is primarily used with input and textarea elements.</li>
        <li>Purpose: It provides a brief description or example of the required input, helping to guide users on what to enter.</li>
        <li>Appearance: The placeholder text appears inside the input field in a lighter color than the input text. It disappears when the user starts typing.</li>    
        <li>Accessibility: While placeholders can be helpful, they should not replace labels (label /label)</li>    
        </ol>
        <ins>Key Attributes:</ins>
        <li>placeholder: Sets the placeholder text for the input or textarea element.</li>
        <li>required: Ensures that the field must be filled out before submission.</li>
        <ins>Limitations:</ins>
        <li>Not a Substitute for Labels: Placeholder text should not replace labels. Labels are important for accessibility and provide more persistent context for form fields.</li>
        <li>Text Disappears: Placeholder text disappears when the user starts typing, so it should not be the sole source of information for users about what to input.</li></p>
        <b>Pattern</b>
        <p>The pattern attribute in HTML is used to specify a regular expression (regex) that an input field's value must match in order for the form to be submitted. This attribute is used with input elements to enforce specific input formats, such as phone numbers, email addresses, or passwords<br><br>
        <ins>Key Points:</ins>
    <ol>
        <li>Regular Expressions: The value of the pattern attribute is a regular expression that defines the allowed input format.</li>
        <li>Validation: If the user input does not match the regular expression, the form will not be submitted, and the browser will display an error message.</li>
        <li> Client-Side Validation: The pattern attribute provides client-side validation, which can enhance user experience by catching input errors before the form is submitted.</li>    
        <li>Compatibility: The pattern attribute is supported by modern browsers, but it is always a good practice to also validate input on the server side to ensure data integrity.</li>    
    </ol>
    <ins>Key Attributes:</ins>
    <li>pattern: Defines the regular expression that the input field’s value must match.</li>
    <li>title: (Optional) Provides a message that will be displayed when the input does not match the pattern. This helps users understand the expected format.</li></p>
    <b>Autofocus</b>
    <p>The autofocus attribute in HTML is used to automatically focus an input field or textarea when a webpage loads. This means that the specified field will be active and ready for user input as soon as the page is displayed, which can enhance user experience by reducing the number of clicks needed to start typing.<br><br>
    <ins>Key Points:</ins>
<ol>
    <li>Automatic Focus: The autofocus attribute is added to a single form element to make it the active element when the page loads.</li>
    <li>Single Usage: Only one element in a document can have the autofocus attribute. If multiple elements have autofocus, only the first one will be focused.</li>    
    <li> Usage: It is often used in forms to streamline the user experience, especially on forms where immediate user input is expected.</li>   
</ol>
<ins>Notes:</ins>
<li>Form Submission: When using autofocus on forms, be mindful of how it affects the user experience, especially on mobile devices or when multiple forms are present.</li>
<li>Accessibility: Ensure that automatic focus does not interfere with users’ ability to navigate the page, particularly for those using screen readers or other assistive technologies.</li></p>
